# SynReco

the SynReco is a python package that wil help you find out the 
similarity of some different texts and expression.

for example the following lines are some good choices for 
the package inputs:

``` c++
int number_1;
int number_2;
float number_4;
float* ptr_number_4{&number_4};
...
```

as you can see there is a similarity here among the sentences.
now by using this project you can find them and classify them.
